            <p>The governing body responsible for overseeing football activities in Tunisia. Established in 1957, the FTF manages the national football teams, including the men's and women's teams, and organizes domestic competitions such as the Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 1. It plays a crucial role in the development of football in the country, focusing on nurturing local talent, promoting the sport at all levels, and representing Tunisia in international football events under the umbrella of FIFA and the Confederation of African Football (CAF).</p>

            <p>The Tunisian Football Federation (FTF) has achieved significant milestones in both domestic and international football. Under its guidance, the Tunisian national team, known as the "Carthage Eagles," has qualified for six FIFA World Cup tournaments, with their first appearance in 1978, where they became the first African team to win a World Cup match. The FTF has also seen success in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), notably when Tunisia won the tournament in 2004, hosted on home soil. Beyond the national team, the FTF has fostered the development of strong club football, with Tunisian clubs such as Esp√©rance de Tunis and Club Africain frequently dominating continental competitions, earning titles in the CAF Champions League and the CAF Confederation Cup. These achievements highlight the FTF's commitment to elevating Tunisian football on both African and global stages.</p>
